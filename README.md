##Description
###Base Functionality
Created a calculator which was able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide on the server side.
It used AJAX request to send and receive the input data.
###Hard mode
Changed the form field inputs into buttons that included numbers, decimal, operators, equal, and clear.
###Pro mode
Styled the layout of the html elements to resemble a calculator using CSS and Bootstrap.
Used client side to determine mathematical operation and change the URL to the correct route.
